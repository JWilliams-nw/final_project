# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021

We have selected Project # 19 for the approved project list.

Team members: Danny Samin, Nehali Patel, Jason Williams

Description: When choosing classes at Kellogg or any other school it would be useful to know who has taken a class you are considering before. We have tools like slack that make it easy to reach out, but nothing that points to the "who", when you are considering a course but would like an opinion. This could be taken a step further to include the ability to find Kellogg Alumni with backgrounds in certain industries. It's easy to connect, but not to know who to connect with. An application that allows you to search for alumni by classes or other descriptors would help students find the right person to connect with.

Professor's feedback: Great idea! I can envision a future version with the alumni search features, but let's stick to the classes data for the MVP - collection of classes, user functionality to identify which classes they've "taken", display of users who took a specific class. That's more than enough!
